          An extra, if you need it. Not the main product. The product is the hub that runs your
          operation. If you also need a public website, we can build it on the same foundation, so your
          shop window and your back office are one system you own.

          Built as separate apps on one stack you own. The public site and the operation keep their
          own boundaries, but share a single home. Standard formats, portable.
